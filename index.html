     <h1>Who We Are?</h1>
     <p>Jesuit education is inspired by the vision of a human being drawn from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who has always been respected and admired by the people of India. It is based on the principles of character formation elaborated by the founder of the society of Jesus, St. Ignatius of Loyola. This vision and these principles give Jesuit institutions a specific character and set before the staff and students ideals of humanism and service towards which they are invited continually to strive after.</p>

            <p>At St. Xavier’s students have a feeling of a home away from home. They are encouraged to ask even the most obvious questions so that they truly understand and learn what is explained. This goes a long way in building the child’s self-confidence. Parents are encouraged to meet the teachers for any reason so that there is no communication gap. Every child is looked after with the same care and dedication by the staff, teachers and management.<br/>

                Dedicated teachers who regularly undergo refresher and training courses ensure that student’s interest in the subject taught by them remains high.<br/>
                
                The school continues to incorporate the best—in—class infrastructure available such as proper ventilated, e-learning classrooms for all students, laboratories, a library, a reading room, a huge well maintained playground and other areas of utility to ensure that our school keeps up with the best standards for learning.<br/>
                
                Extra—Curricular activities are treated with as much respect as academics. Students are encouraged to participate in at least one of the many activities offered. This ensures the all round development of children.</p>
